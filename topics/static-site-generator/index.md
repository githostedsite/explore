There are two broad types of modern static site generators: 
- Traditional static site generators: They are not prescriptive on how the frontend of your site is built. Their job is simply to generate the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assets, not to dictate how they are built.
- JavaScript static site generators: They are built using a JavaScript framework like React, Vue, or Angular. In these cases, the SSG still generates static assets, but those use the prescribed frontend framework and may generate content at build time or load it client-side at runtime as in a typical single page application (SPA).
